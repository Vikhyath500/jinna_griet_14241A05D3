Q1)Insert,Search and Delete in a tree

Insert:
1.An unordered tree is taken
2.Two nodes s1,s2 are taken as input which have to be inserted in tree
3.pre-order traversal is done on the tree,i.e Root Left Right
4.s1 is compared with each node while traversing
5.After finding s1 node, node is inserted according to position either left or right
6.The node is added to the tree

Search:
1.An unordered tree is taken
2.A node s is taken as input which has to be searched in tree
3.pre-order traversal is done on the tree,i.e Root Left Right
4.s is compared with each node while traversing
5.If node matches return node found
6.Else return node not found

Delete:
1.An unordered tree is taken
2.A node s is taken as input which has to be deleted in tree
3.pre-order traversal is done on the tree,i.e Root Left Right
4.s is compared with each node while traversing
5.If node matches then swap it with its immediate left node
