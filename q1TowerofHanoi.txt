Q1)Tower of Hanoi with and without recursion

1.Calculate the total number of moves required i.e."pow(2,n)-1" here n is number of disks.
2.If number of disks (i.e.n) is even then interchange destination pole and auxiliary pole.
3.for i=1 to total number of moves:
     if i%3==1:
    legal movement of top disk between source pole and destination pole
     if i%3 == 2:
    legal movement top disk between source pole and auxiliary pole    
     if i%3 == 0:
        legal movement top disk between auxiliary pole and destination pole
