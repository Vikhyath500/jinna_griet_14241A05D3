Q5)Floyd's Cycle

1.Create a Data Structure to store a linked list node
struct Node
{
   int data;
   Node* next;
};

2.Create a new linked list node from heap
Node* newNode = new Node;

newNode->data = data;
newNode->next = headRef;
headRef = newNode;

3.Take two pointers - slow and fast
Node *slow = head, *fast = head;
while (fast && fast->next)
{
       a.move slow by one pointer
       slow = slow->next;
       b.move fast by two pointers
       fast = fast->next->next;
       c.if they meet any any node,linked list contains a cycle
       d.if (slow == fast):
	    return true;
}

4.We reach here if slow & fast pointer do not meet
       return false;
